Code description This code is used to identify and classify the micro-images of inertinite macerals. We investigate a wavelet leaders-basedmultifractal spectrumanalysis technique. There are many code files in the folder. Among them, mian.m is the main program, and other codes are its subroutines.  The WaveletLeaders.m are used to calculate the wavelet leaders. The DMFS.m is used to obtain multifractal spectrum (DMFS) directly  by defining a canonical framework. The User guide.txt provide guidance on how to use this code.
